With a recent upgrade of some old wedges and redo in the bag, I was hitting these more consistently with better feel and spin than any others out there at my independent fitting. Love them and can't wait to get out next spring with these.",reviewer_name:"Tyler"},{url:"/cleveland-golf/clubs/wedges/rtz/rtz-tour-rack-(raw)-wedge/MRTZTR.html",review_header:"Great wedge!",review_description:"Excellent all-around playability. Looks great, spin is perfect, and I love the default swing weight. Solid feel, versatile, and the best wedge on the market right now.

Excellent feel, plenty of spin, and consistent performance on chips and pitches. It also feels great with a full swing. Definitely a quality upgrade for the short game.",reviewer_name:"David"},{url:"/srixon/clubs/irons/zxi5-irons/zxi5-irons/MZXI5IRN.html",review_header:"Incredible irons for a wide range of handicaps",review_description:"The Srixon ZXi5 irons are easily the best set of irons I've owned. They are incredibly consistent, very forgiving for their category, and beautiful to look down on. It's amazing how much technology they've packed into these irons, all while keeping them sleek in appearance. The feel is wonderful, and there is enough feedback to know exactly where you hit the ball on the face to make adjustments. I will be playing these for years to come.",reviewer_name:"NJ"},{url:"/srixon/clubs/irons/zxi7-irons/zxi7-irons/MZXI7IRN.html",review_header:"ZXi7 are great. Definitely recommend them",review_description:"I replaced my 4-year-old ZX7 iron set with the new ZXi7. The new clubs are fantastic. I did not think they could improve on the ZX7, but they found a way to do it. They feel softer than my old set and are definitely straighter and a bit more forgiving. I would say handicaps as high as 15–18 can easily play these fantastic-looking clubs.",reviewer_name:"TM"},{url:"/srixon/clubs/irons/zxi4-irons/zxi4-irons/MZXI4IRN.html",review_header:"Srixon does it again!",review_description:"The new generation of ZX4 irons has further helped me improve my game.

Hitting the ball off the tee with more distance (at least 10–20 yards). Misses still produce a long drive. When I hit it flush, the ball explodes off the face of the club and goes a mile. Very happy with my new XXIO 13 driver.
